Shapes Module
=============

.. module:: cad_datamodel.shapes

The shapes module provides concrete implementations of various geometric shapes.

.. note::
   This module is planned for implementation in Epic 2. This documentation
   serves as a placeholder for the upcoming shape implementations.

Planned Shapes
--------------

Rectangle
~~~~~~~~~

A rectangular shape defined by position and dimensions.

**Planned Attributes:**

- ``x``: X coordinate of top-left corner
- ``y``: Y coordinate of top-left corner
- ``width``: Width of the rectangle
- ``height``: Height of the rectangle

Circle
~~~~~~

A circular shape defined by center and radius.

**Planned Attributes:**

- ``cx``: X coordinate of center
- ``cy``: Y coordinate of center
- ``radius``: Radius of the circle

Line
~~~~

A line segment between two points.

**Planned Attributes:**

- ``x1``: Starting X coordinate
- ``y1``: Starting Y coordinate
- ``x2``: Ending X coordinate
- ``y2``: Ending Y coordinate

Polygon
~~~~~~~

A closed shape with multiple vertices.

**Planned Attributes:**

- ``points``: List of vertices as Point objects

Polyline
~~~~~~~~

An open shape with multiple vertices.

**Planned Attributes:**

- ``points``: List of vertices as Point objects

Group
~~~~~

A container for multiple shapes.

**Planned Attributes:**

- ``shapes``: List of child shapes
- ``transform``: Group transformation matrix
