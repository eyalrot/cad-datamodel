# Story 1.3: CI Pipeline Setup

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to set up GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline,
**so that** code quality is automatically verified on every push and PR.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. CI pipeline runs on every push and pull request
2. Pipeline tests against Python 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, and 3.12
3. Type checking with mypy passes in pipeline
4. Linting with ruff passes in pipeline
5. All unit tests pass with coverage reporting
6. Pipeline configuration follows architecture specifications
7. Build artifacts are properly cached for performance

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Create CI workflow file (AC: 1, 6)
  - [ ] Create .github/workflows/ci.yml
  - [ ] Configure trigger on push and pull_request events
  - [ ] Set up proper job permissions
- [ ] Configure Python matrix testing (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Set up strategy matrix for Python versions
  - [ ] Configure Python setup action
  - [ ] Cache pip dependencies
- [ ] Add code quality checks (AC: 3, 4)
  - [ ] Add mypy type checking step
  - [ ] Add ruff linting step
  - [ ] Configure both to use project config files
- [ ] Set up test execution (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Run pytest with coverage
  - [ ] Generate coverage reports
  - [ ] Upload coverage artifacts
- [ ] Add build verification (AC: 7)
  - [ ] Verify package builds correctly
  - [ ] Test installation in fresh environment
  - [ ] Cache build artifacts between jobs
- [ ] Create release workflow placeholder
  - [ ] Create .github/workflows/release.yml (inactive)
  - [ ] Document release process for future

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.2: Core module implemented with full test coverage. CI can now validate the codebase.

### Architecture CI/CD Requirements
[Source: architecture.md#10]
- Tool: GitHub Actions
- Location: .github/workflows/
- Automated testing across Python 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12
- PyPI deployment on tagged releases (future story)

### Testing Strategy
[Source: architecture.md#13.4]
- Run on every push and PR
- Performance tests on nightly schedule (future)
- Dependency scanning via GitHub security

### Pipeline Steps Required
1. Checkout code
2. Set up Python (matrix)
3. Install dependencies
4. Run linting (ruff)
5. Run type checking (mypy)
6. Run tests with coverage
7. Build package
8. Upload artifacts

### File Locations
- .github/workflows/ci.yml - Main CI pipeline
- .github/workflows/release.yml - Release pipeline (placeholder)

### Testing Requirements
The CI pipeline itself should test:
- Multiple Python versions in parallel
- All development tools work correctly
- Package installs successfully
- Tests pass with good coverage

### Technical Constraints
- Use GitHub-hosted runners
- Complete in under 10 minutes
- Cache dependencies for speed
- Fail fast on first error

### Testing
- Test file location: N/A (workflow files)
- Test standards: Pipeline must complete successfully
- Testing frameworks: GitHub Actions
- Specific requirements: All checks must pass before merge
