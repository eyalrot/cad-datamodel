# CAD Drawing Application - Epic Definitions

## Overview

This document defines the development epics for the CAD Drawing Application data model library. Each epic represents a major deliverable that provides value and can be developed independently while building toward the complete system.

**Value Delivered:** Full shape system supporting complex drawings with nested groups and polygons.

### Key Deliverables:
- Polygon shape implementation
- Polyline shape implementation
- Group container with hierarchy support
- Nested group capabilities
- Group transform inheritance
- Bounds calculation for groups
- Performance optimization for large groups

### Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Polygons support open and closed variants
- [ ] Groups can contain any shape including other groups
- [ ] Circular references are prevented
- [ ] Group transforms propagate to children
- [ ] Performance: 10,000 shapes in nested groups < 100ms operations
- [ ] Memory efficient for large hierarchies

### Dependencies:
- Epic 2 must be complete

## Epic 4: Layers & Style System

**Goal:** Implement layer management and comprehensive styling capabilities.

**Value Delivered:** Complete organizational system with layers and rich visual styling options.

### Key Deliverables:
- Layer class with z-ordering
- Layer manager for CRUD operations
- Style class with all properties
- Style inheritance system
- Color parsing and validation
- Default styles per shape type
- Layer-shape relationship management

### Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Layers maintain consistent z-order
- [ ] Shapes can only belong to one layer
- [ ] Layer deletion handles shape reassignment
- [ ] Styles support all defined properties
- [ ] Color formats: hex, RGB, RGBA, named

## Story Estimation

### Epic Sizes (Story Points):
- **Epic 1:** 13 points (Setup complexity)
- **Epic 2:** 21 points (Core functionality)  
- **Epic 3:** 21 points (Complex shapes)
- **Epic 4:** 13 points (Layers and styles)
- **Epic 5:** 34 points (Persistence complexity)
- **Epic 6:** 13 points (Quality and release)

**Total:** 115 story points

### Velocity Assumptions:
- AI Agent velocity: 8-13 points per session
- Estimated sessions: 10-15 sessions
- Each session includes implementation, testing, and code review

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks:
1. **Performance with 100k+ shapes**
   - Mitigation: Implement spatial indexing early
   - Validate with benchmarks in each epic

2. **SVG compatibility**
   - Mitigation: Test with real-world SVG files
   - Focus on SVG subset used by CAD tools

3. **Memory usage with nested groups**
   - Mitigation: Lazy evaluation patterns
   - Cache invalidation strategy

### Process Risks:
1. **Scope creep**
   - Mitigation: Defer advanced features to Phase 2
   - Maintain focus on MVP data model

2. **API design changes**
   - Mitigation: Design review after Epic 1
   - Keep interfaces minimal and focused
