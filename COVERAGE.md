| `core/base.py` | 71 | 19 | 73% | Abstract methods (expected) |
| `core/constants.py` | 50 | 0 | 100% | ✅ Full coverage |
| `core/exceptions.py` | 50 | 0 | 100% | ✅ Full coverage |
| `core/types.py` | 127 | 0 | 100% | ✅ Full coverage |
| Other modules | 6 | 6 | 0% | Not yet implemented |
| **TOTAL** | **311** | **25** | **92%** | |

## Detailed Analysis

### Fully Covered Modules (100%)

1. **core/types.py** - All type definitions, enums, and classes fully tested:
   - `Point` and `Bounds` classes
   - `Color` class with all conversion methods
   - `Transform` class with all transformation methods
   - All enumerations (`ShapeType`, `LineCap`, `LineJoin`, `Units`)

2. **core/exceptions.py** - Complete exception hierarchy tested:
   - All custom exceptions
   - Exception initialization and error details
   - Exception inheritance chain

3. **core/constants.py** - All constants verified:
   - Default values
   - Coordinate limits
   - Named colors dictionary

### Partially Covered Modules

**core/base.py (73% coverage)**
- Missing lines are all `pass` statements in abstract methods
- This is expected and correct for abstract base classes
- No actual logic is untested

### Not Yet Implemented (0% coverage)

These modules only contain placeholder `__init__.py` files:
- `geometry/__init__.py`
- `layers/__init__.py`
- `persistence/__init__.py`
- `shapes/__init__.py`
- `styles/__init__.py`
- `transform/__init__.py`

These will be implemented in future epics.

## Test Quality Metrics

### Test Organization
- Tests are well-organized by class/functionality
- Clear test names following `test_<what_is_being_tested>` pattern
- Comprehensive edge case coverage

### Test Categories
- **Unit Tests**: 48 (100%)
- **Integration Tests**: 0 (planned for future)
- **Performance Tests**: 0 (planned for future)

### Key Test Areas

1. **Type System Tests** (15 tests)
   - Enumerations
   - Type aliases
   - Immutability checks

2. **Geometry Tests** (13 tests)
   - Point operations
   - Bounds calculations
   - Transform mathematics

3. **Color System Tests** (7 tests)
   - Color creation and validation
   - Format conversions
   - Alpha channel handling

4. **Exception Tests** (9 tests)
   - Exception creation
   - Error message formatting
   - Exception details

5. **Interface Tests** (4 tests)
   - Abstract class instantiation prevention
   - Mock implementation verification

## Running Coverage

To generate coverage reports:

```bash
# Terminal report
pytest tests/unit/test_core.py --cov=src/cad_datamodel --cov-report=term-missing

# HTML report
pytest tests/unit/test_core.py --cov=src/cad_datamodel --cov-report=html

# XML report (for CI integration)
pytest tests/unit/test_core.py --cov=src/cad_datamodel --cov-report=xml
```

## Coverage Goals

- **Current**: 92% overall coverage
- **Target**: Maintain >90% coverage as new features are added
- **Strategy**: Write tests before or alongside implementation

## HTML Coverage Report

An HTML coverage report has been generated in the `htmlcov/` directory.
To view it locally:

```bash
cd htmlcov
python3 -m http.server 8000
# Then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

## Continuous Integration

Coverage is automatically checked on every push via GitHub Actions:
- Tests run on Python 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, and 3.12
- Coverage reports are uploaded as artifacts
- Coverage must remain above 90% for PRs to be merged
